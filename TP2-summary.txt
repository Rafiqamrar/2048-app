# TP2 Summary

In this TP2, I followed the instructions to work with the 2048-app project using Git and GitHub:

- I forked the teacher's repository (TechWatching/2048-app) to my own GitHub account.
- I created a new branch called `lab2` in my forked repository to work on the TP2 tasks.
- All my changes and answers for TP2 were made in the `lab2` branch.
- I pushed my work to the `lab2` branch on my fork, so the teacher can review my answers.
- I also set the original teacher's repository as the `upstream` remote to keep my fork up to date if needed.

This workflow ensures my work is organized, versioned, and easy for the teacher to check.
